# cp\_gen/tests

Rules: 
* Tests must be in `tests/${DS}Tester.hpp` for the data structure named `$DS`
* The class in `${DS}Tester.hpp` must be named `${DS}Tester`
* The class must have a static entry point called `runTests()`, which will called by the C++ file that is generated by `./Makefile`. This function should also return `false` if one of the tests fails, else return `true`.
* All test functions must return a boolean.
* All functions in `${DS}Tester.hpp` must be static
* You may use the `cpassert(__EXPRESSION)` macro to return `false` if `__EXPRESSION` evaluates to `false`. Else, continues.
* Include `lib/${DS}.hpp` file and all of its dependencies. The ${DS} file should have `#pragma once` at the top of it to avoid being included multiple times despite being needed by multiple libraries
